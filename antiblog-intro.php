		<p>Hello! My name is Ornit Kravitz, and I am the owner of KAMEO Antiparos, a boutique hotel that opened about two months ago (August 2022) in Agios Georgios.. I am 47 years old, and I am happily married with three beautiful children: Amit, Maya and Ella, whose names help create KAMEO.</p>
		<p>I am not Greek (yet)—I am Israeli. Before KAMEO, I was not involved with running hotels. I was a criminal prosecutor for ten years, the head of international affairs for the ISA (the Israeli regulator of the capital market) and in recent years, I was a partner in an Israeli-French venture capital (Maor Investments).</p>
		<p>In August 2021, for various reasons that I might write about in the future, I began my journey to open a boutique hotel in Greece. I left my professional career in Israel, created a Greek company, opened a Greek bank account (which was a nightmare!), started to learn Greek (and Greek cuisine), completed the acquisition of the hotel (and a few more plots nearby) and began renovations from scratch in March 2022 (changing anything and everything that could be changed—watch short video attached). In August 2022, exactly one year later, I proudly opened KAMEO Antiparos.</p>
		<!-- video here -->
		<p>Why Greece? Well, I always had a passion for everything about it—its history, archaeology, mythology, language, cuisine, music—you get the picture. But why Antiparos? That is exactly what this blog is about.</p>
		<p>This blog is not about me or KAMEO. Its purpose is to discover what it is about this tiny island that makes total foreigners like me react so strongly to it. Is it the ancient Greek history found in every corner of this island? The archaeological magic of the bay with the Temple of Apollo directly across from it? Or is it the wild secret beaches? The stylish boutiques? I still don’t know what it is exactly, but I am eager to find out.</p>
		<p>I invite you to take this journey with me so we can unfold the magic together.</p>
